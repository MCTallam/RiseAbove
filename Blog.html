     <p>Whenever a boundary is defined to set one thing apart from another, there is rarely space for middle ground. For compromise. For an in-between. But the truth is the human experience cannot be viewed behind a binary lens of black and white. Truth and deceit. Success and failure. Good and evil, because all these are […]</p>

      <p>The consistent presence of anything can often be considered mundane. Expected. So it’s value naturally depreciates over time, until it stagnates. A sigmoid curve of sorts, where you can no longer imagine your life without it. Because it has always been there. So when one day the rug is pulled from beneath your feet and […]</p>

Giving us the feeling of knowing enough about a certain subject to talk about it, but not enough to experience it first hand. Most times privilege is not really financial or racial or any other shallow demographic we may use to divide us. Privilege […]</p>
